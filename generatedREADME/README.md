  ## Description

An important component of your GitHub profile—and one that many new developers often overlook—is the README file. The quality of a README often discerns a good project over a bad project. A good one is an valueable opportunity to explain and display what your application does.

A good README helps the you excel over other developers putting their work on GitHub.
